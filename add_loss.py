        This loss expects as input a batch consisting of sentence pairs ``(a_1, p_1), (a_2, p_2)..., (a_n, p_n)``
        where we assume that ``(a_i, p_i)`` are a positive pair and ``(a_i, p_j)`` for ``i != j`` a negative pair.

        For each ``a_i``, it uses all other ``p_j`` as negative samples, i.e., for ``a_i``, we have 1 positive example
        (``p_i``) and ``n-1`` negative examples (``p_j``). It then minimizes the negative log-likehood for softmax
        normalized scores.

        This loss function works great to train embeddings for retrieval setups where you have positive pairs
        (e.g. (query, relevant_doc)) as it will sample in each batch ``n-1`` negative docs randomly.

        The performance usually increases with increasing batch sizes.

        You can also provide one or multiple hard negatives per anchor-positive pair by structuring the data like this:
        ``(a_1, p_1, n_1), (a_2, p_2, n_2)``. Then, ``n_1`` is a hard negative for ``(a_1, p_1)``. The loss will use for
        the pair ``(a_i, p_i)`` all ``p_j`` for ``j != i`` and all ``n_j`` as negatives.

        Args:
            model: SentenceTransformer model
            scale: Output of similarity function is multiplied by scale
                value

                embeddings. By default, cos_sim. Can also be set to dot

        Relations:
            - :class:`CachedMultipleNegativesRankingLoss` is equivalent to this loss, but it uses caching that allows for
              much higher batch sizes (and thus better performance) without extra memory usage. However, it requires more
              training time.
            - :class:`MultipleNegativesSymmetricRankingLoss` is equivalent to this loss, but with an additional loss term.
            - :class:`GISTEmbedLoss` is equivalent to this loss, but uses a guide model to guide the in-batch negative
              sample selection. `GISTEmbedLoss` yields a stronger training signal at the cost of some training overhead.

            model: SentenceTransformer model
            distance_metric: Function that returns a distance between
                two embeddings. The class SiameseDistanceMetric contains
                pre-defined metrics that can be used.

        Definitions:
            :Easy triplets: Triplets which have a loss of 0 because
                ``distance(anchor, positive) + margin < distance(anchor, negative)``.
            :Hard triplets: Triplets where the negative is closer to the anchor than the positive, i.e.,
                ``distance(anchor, negative) < distance(anchor, positive)``.
            :Semi-hard triplets: Triplets where the negative is not closer to the anchor than the positive, but which
                still have a positive loss, i.e., ``distance(anchor, positive) < distance(anchor, negative) + margin``.

        Requirements:
            1. Each sentence must be labeled with a class.
            2. Your dataset must contain at least 2 examples per labels class.
            3. Your dataset should contain hard positives and negatives.

        Relations:
            * :class:`BatchHardTripletLoss` uses a user-specified margin, while this loss does not require setting a margin.
